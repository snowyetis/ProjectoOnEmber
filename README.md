# ProjectoOnEmber

Projolecto is an extremely light project creation app.
This application was written using the following languages.

Ruby 2.2.2
Rails 4.2.4
Ember 1.13.8
Ember Data 2.2.1
Ember-cli

The authentication is handle within the API using Devise and has been overloaded to respond to Ember's requests. Assisting the front-end, Ember-Simple-Auth has been implemented.

Data is handled with SQLite3. Once in production POSTGRES or MySQL will be added.

The application demonstrates how to handle embedded records and nested resources. The use of components have been added to keep the code base DRY.

This is a work in progress and there are many additions needed before this is complete.
